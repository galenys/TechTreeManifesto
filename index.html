            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The Society for Technological Advancement (SoTA) is hosting its second event on the 1st and 2nd of June
                2024. This time it is a 'hackathon' which aims to lionise the undiscovered and overlooked pathways of
                various technoscientific disciplines. We hope to bring together talented, ambitious, rigorous, and
                enthusiastic individuals for two days of creation. The motivation for doing so is to encourage
                innovators to explore and maximise the variance of technologies which are available, big or small. This
                will avoid the dangers that over-specialisation in specific technologies, such as fossil fuels, posed to
                human flourishing.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Tech Tree</h2>
            <p>The 'tech tree' is a metaphor for the branching paths of progress throughout human history. This concept
                was popularised by video games, where players might unlock 'steel-making' before advancing to 'steam
                engines.' The branching paths of progress often come with an opportunity cost, meaning that progress
                down a presently lucrative path may accelerate at the expense of others. This is over-specialisation,
                manifesting as a single-point failure if the technology has significant downsides that were not clear
                upon adoption.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Human history is mostly a zero-sum game. But every once in a while, things have gotten radically better,
                permanently, for everyone. These step changes in the human condition are synonymous with technology. The
                invention of fire, the wheel, electricity, and of the personal computer changed the world for better and
                for always.</p>
            <p>It is important, and perhaps easier to continuously refine and improve existing and established
                technological approaches than explore.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Role</h2>
            <p>It can sometimes feel like everything has already been discovered. There are no foreign shores in a world
                with satellite technology. But we claim that our exploration of the tech tree has only just begun.</p>
            <p>There are branches of progress that have been either ignored or intentionally overlooked. Analogue
                computers and electric cars both preceded their modern counterparts, yet revisiting them reveals
                untapped potential. We've become highly specialised in fruitful industries like fossil fuels and
                photolithography, but have certainly left valuable ideas from the past unexplored.</p>
            <p>We think the world would be a better place if more people took it upon themselves to be explorers and
                creators, not just consumers.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">That's where you come in.</p>
