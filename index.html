            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The Society for Technological Advancement (SoTA) is hosting its second event on the 1st and 2nd of June
                2024. This time it is a 'hackathon' which aims to lionise the undiscovered and overlooked pathways of
                various technoscientific disciplines. We hope to bring together talented, ambitious, rigorous, and
                enthusiastic individuals for two days of creation. The motivation for doing so is to encourage
                innovators to explore and maximise the variance of technologies which are available, big or small. This
                will avoid the dangers that over-specialisation in specific technologies, such as fossil fuels, posed to
                human flourishing.</p>

            <h2>The Tech Tree</h2>
            <p>The 'tech tree' is a metaphor for the branching paths of progress throughout human history - a concept
                popularised by video games, where players might unlock 'steel-making' before advancing to 'steam
                engines.' The branching paths of progress often come with an opportunity cost, meaning that progress
                down a presently lucrative path may accelerate at the expense of others. This is over-specialisation,
                manifesting as a single-point failure if the technology has significant downsides that were not clear
                upon adoption.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Human history has often been conflict and zero-sum games. But every once in a while, things have gotten
                radically better, permanently, for everyone. These step changes in the human condition are synonymous
                with technology. The invention of fire, the wheel, electricity, and of the personal computer changed the
                world forever and for the better.</p>
            <p>While improving existing paths is vital, in uncertain environments it is better to search broadly than to
                follow the direct path. Like Lichtenberg figures, finding the optimal path is often not without its
                branches and diversions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Role</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it can feel like everything has already been discovered. There are no foreign shores in a world
                with satellite technology. But we claim that our exploration of the tech tree has only just begun.</p>
            <p>There are branches of progress that have been either ignored or intentionally overlooked. Analogue
                computers and electric cars both preceded their modern counterparts, yet revisiting them reveals
                untapped potential. We've become highly specialised in fruitful industries like fossil fuels and
                photolithography, but have certainly left valuable ideas unexplored.</p>
            <p>We think the world would be a better place if more people took it upon themselves to be explorers and
                creators, not just consumers.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">That's where you come in.</p>
